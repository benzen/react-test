REACT-test
------------------

Things that surprise us
-----------------------

Stricter dom api (input tag must closed)
React/Flux loop seem heavy, but based on simple blocks
Syntaxe to access to real dom node is fucked up (this.refs.labels.getDOMNode().value && @ref) 
Some dom attribute are counter intuituve (class vs. className)
Events must be stopped (back to e.stopPropagation() & e.preventDefault())


Things to explore
--------------------

Test with Jest (https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
Dependecies between stores. Could be to for selected issue, unless you've got better idea
Is this crazyness working on IE 9
Working with CSX (coffee) instead of JSX
